# modifiedbccscene
I do NOT own this. This is a modified version of a free scene from BCC. See the original here: https://github.com/BryceCanyonCounty/bcc-scene.

This version disables the print to f8 that continually pings the client and also disables the key binds that get in the way of other keybinds. Instead commands are used. These commands are:
/scene
/scene:place
/scene:edit
